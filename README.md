# Folding@home docker containers

![No Magic](pics/dontbelieveinmagic.jpg)

This repo provides docker containers to run the folding@home client. 

So this is one way of getting Folding@Home done. It has all the usual benefits
of Docker containerization. Assuming you are already a docker user the install
should take a few minutes, most of which is building the containers. Perhaps
I'll push this to dockerhub later, idk.

# Install

## Prepare the docker environment if you have a Nvidia GPU

Be sure `docker` 19.03 or higher as well as the `nvidia-container-toolkit` is
installed. If docker is already installed be sure to restart docker after
installing `nvidia-container-toolkit`

For arch this would be:

```
$ yay -S docker nvidia-container-toolkit
$ sudo systemctl restart docker
```

Ubuntu or whatever will be very similar.

Once this is done run the `test-gpu.sh` script to verify your GPU's are available:

``` zsh
‚ùØ ./test-gpu.sh

# Run

So docker-compose does not support the --gpus flag at this time, so you have to
slum it with the `run-gpu.sh` script.

```zsh
$ ./run-gpu.sh -u sthysel -t 248479
```

If you have FAH passkey make sure its in your environment called `FAH_PASSKEY`
